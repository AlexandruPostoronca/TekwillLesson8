<h2>The main method</h2>
<h4>The declaration of the main method</h4>
<p>Java is primarily an object-oriented language. It means a Java program can be considered as a collection of objects
    that communicate via calling each other's methods. A typical Java program includes a lot of classes, interfaces,
    objects, and other concepts from object-oriented programming.</p>
<p>Even the simplest "procedural-style" program should have at least one class and the main method inside to start the
    program. The main method is the entry point for any application. It means that the execution of any program begins
    right here. Ever since Java 7, there has been no other way to start an application than with this method (excluding
    the case in which you start your application inside a special container for applications but this is not considered
    in our materials).</p>
<p>Let's see an example of the simplest application that prints the text <strong>"Hello, Java"</strong> to the standard
    output:</p>
<pre><code>public class Main {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello, Java");
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Here is a class named <code>Main</code>. The class contains <strong>the main method</strong> for starting the
    program.</p>
<p>It is important to mention that a class containing the main method can have any name, but the main method should
    always have the name <code>main</code>.</p>
<p>Let's take a closer look at the declaration of the main method:</p>
<pre><code>public static void main(String[] args)</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>the keyword <code>public</code> indicates that the method can be invoked from everywhere;</li>
    <li>the keyword <code>static</code> indicates the method can be invoked without creating an instance of the class;
    </li>
    <li>the keyword <code>void</code> indicates the method doesn't return any value;</li>
    <li>the array variable <code>args</code> contains arguments entered at the command line, the array is empty if there
        are no arguments.
    </li>
</ul>
<p>As you can see, even the simplest Java application contains a lot of concepts. All of them will be studied in the
    next topics related to methods and object-oriented programming. Now you should just understand how to write and run
    a simple Java program with <strong>the main method</strong>.</p>

<h4>Invalid declarations of the main method</h4>
<p>If the main method has an invalid declaration, two cases are possible:</p>
<ul>
    <li>your program cannot be compiled</li>
    <li>your program is successfully compiled but can't be started</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Your program cannot be compiled. </strong>This is the case when the main method declaration breaks the syntax
    of Java.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>invalid method declaration: no return value (even <code>void</code>).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>public static main(String[] args)</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>invalid method declaration: a mistake in the keyword (<code>pulic</code> instead of <code>public</code>).</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>pulic static void main(String[] args)</code></pre>
<p><strong>A program can be compiled but cannot be run.</strong> This is the case when the main method has a correct
    declaration as a regular method but doesn't satisfy the specific requirement of the main method.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
    <li>invalid arguments (should be <code>String[] args</code>)</li>
</ul>
<pre><code>public static void main(String args) {
    System.out.println("Hello, Java");
}</code></pre>
<ul>
    <li>the method declaration has no keyword <code>static</code></li>
</ul>
<pre><code>public void main(String[] args) { 
    System.out.println("Hello, Java");
} </code></pre>
<p>In both cases, an error happens at runtime.</p>

<h4>Conclusion</h4>
<p>So, the main method is the entry point of any Java program. It has a very specific syntax which you need to
    remember.</p>
