<h2>Calculator with four methods</h2>
<p>In a template below you have a simple calculator that subtracts, sums, divides, and multiplies the two numbers
    inside the switch statement. Now, we've decided to upgrade it to perform more complex tasks, such as logarithmic
    functions. For that, separate methods are a better solution. Let's start with decomposing what we have.</p>

<p>Take a look at the template and decompose operations of the calculator into four methods:
    <code>subtractTwoNumbers(long a, long b)</code> for subtraction, <code>sumTwoNumbers(long a, long b)</code> for
    adding, <code>divideTwoNumbers(long a, long b)</code> for integer division and
    <code>multiplyTwoNumbers(long a, long b)</code> for multiplication. Each method should print the result of
    calculations.
</p>

<p>Note that you can't divide by zero. In case your second argument is zero, you should print the "<strong>Division by
    0!</strong>" message.</p>
<div><p><strong> Sample Input 1: </strong></p>
    <pre>1 + 2</pre>
    <p><strong> Sample Output 1: </strong></p>
    <pre>3</pre>
</div>
<div><p><strong> Sample Input 2: </strong></p>
    <pre>4 / 0</pre>
    <p><strong> Sample Output 2: </strong></p>
    <pre>Division by 0!</pre>
