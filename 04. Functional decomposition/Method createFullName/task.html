<h2>Method createFullName</h2>
<p>In the code template below, you can see a program that creates a full name from the first and last names for
    several people. Wouldn't it be much easier if we had a method that could do the same?</p><p>Your task is to create
    the method <code>createFullName</code> that takes <code>firstName</code> and <code>lastName</code> (in this order)
    and returns the full name. </p>
