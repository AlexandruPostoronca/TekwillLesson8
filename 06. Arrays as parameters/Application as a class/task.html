<h2>Application as a class</h2>
<p>You are given a class named <code>Application</code>.</p>

<p>Implement an instance method  <code>run(String[] args)</code> that takes an array of strings and returns nothing. The method should output all the strings in the array, each on a new line.</p>

<p>Let's consider the example. Suppose the <code>run</code> method is invoked with the following argument: <code>["arg1", "arg2", "arg3"]</code></p>

<p>In this case, the method's output will be:</p>

<pre><code>arg1
arg2
arg3</code></pre>
